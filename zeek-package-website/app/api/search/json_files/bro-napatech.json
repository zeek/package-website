Set the following values within your **ntservice.ini**:\n\n```\n ## These values are already defined within your ntservice.ini, so make sure you replace them, don't add new ones. \n PacketDescriptor = NT\n TimestampFormat = NATIVE_UNIX\n```\n\n**Note: in this version of bro-napatech, you must configure an ntpl script to create DYN4 packet descriptors.**\n\nIt is recommended that you comment out the ntpcap.ini completely so that it doesn't conflict with other configuration.\n\nFinally, you'll need to write an ntpl script to define the streams that you will use. \n\nUsage\n-----\n\nOnce installed, you can reference Napatech stream IDs by prefixing them with ``napatech::`` on the command line. \n\nFor example, to monitor ``stream 9``:\n\n```\nbro -i napatech::9\n```\n\nTo use it in production with multiple Bro processes, use a configuraiton similar to this in node.cfg:\n\n```\n[worker-1]\ntype=worker\nhost=localhost\ninterface=napatech::1\n\n[worker-2]\ntype=worker\nhost=localhost\ninterface=napatech::2\n```\n"}
