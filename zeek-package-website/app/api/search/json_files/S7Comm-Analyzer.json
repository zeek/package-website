S7CommPlus analyzer is not finished and works to some\nextend. It covers the base functions of this protocol and can be used to log some events, but\nnot the data (they will not be parsed).\n\nThis plugin was written as a part of a master's thesis at Fachhochschule in Aachen (Aachen\nUniversity of Applied Sciences). It was only tested with self-generated .pcap files from a Siemens\nS7 1204 and some .pcap files I found in other GitHub repositories.\n \nBased on the Wireshark dissector written by Thomas Wiens \nhttps://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/5d99febe66e96b55a1defa58a906be254bad3a51/epan/dissectors/packet-s7comm.c,\nhttps://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/5d99febe66e96b55a1defa58a906be254bad3a51/epan/dissectors/packet-s7comm.h,\nhttps://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/fe219637a6748130266a0b0278166046e60a2d68/epan/dissectors/packet-s7comm_szl_ids.h,\nhttps://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/fe219637a6748130266a0b0278166046e60a2d68/epan/dissectors/packet-s7comm_szl_ids.c,\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/s7commwireshark/\n\npartially on the PoC S7Comm-Bro-Plugin written by Gy\u00f6rgy Miru\nhttps://github.com/CrySyS/bro-step7-plugin/blob/master/README.md,\n\nRFC 1006 (ISO Transport Service on top of the TCP)\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1006\n\nand RFC 905 (ISO Transport Protocol Specification)\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0905\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAs I mentioned before, I have never tested this analyzer on in a production environment.\nTherefore, I do not take responsibility for any damage or loss caused by this piece of software.\n"}
