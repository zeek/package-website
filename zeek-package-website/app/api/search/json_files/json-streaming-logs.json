Files are rotated in the current log directory without\nbeing compressed so that any log shipper has a while to catch up before the\nlog file is deleted.\n\nLogs are named in such a way that a glob in your log shipper configuration\nshould be able to easily match all of the logs.  Each log will have a prefix of\n`json_streaming_` so that the http log would have the full name of\n`json_streaming_http.log`.\n\nLoading this script also doesn't impact any other existing logs that Zeek\noutputs.  If you would like to disable other log output from Zeek, you can change\nthe `JSONStreaming::disable_default_logs` variable to `T`to disable all of the default\nlogs.  The only potential issue is that your logs will become completely\nephemeral with this change because no logs will be rotated into local storage.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nPlease reach out to <info@corelight.com> if you have issues with this script\nor if you have thoughts on ways this could better fit into your environment.\n"}
