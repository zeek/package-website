If you have written a Spicy\nanalyzer that you would like to see included here, please file a pull\nrequest.\n\n<sup>[1] replaces the corresponding Zeek analyzer</sup>\\\n<sup>[2] replaces and extends the corresponding Zeek analyzer</sup>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIn addition to Zeek, you will first need to install Spicy. Please\nfollow [its instructions](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/installation.html).\nEnsure that the Spicy toolchain is in your ``PATH``. For example, with\nit installed to `/opt/spicy` and using `bash`:\n\n    export PATH=/opt/spicy/bin:$PATH\n\nNow `which` should be able to find `spicy-config`:\n\n    # which spicy-config\n    /opt/spicy/bin/spicy-config\n\nPlease also [install and configure](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)\nthe Zeek package manager.\n\nFinally, you will need the [Spicy plugin for\nZeek](https://github.com/zeek/spicy-plugin), which you can install\nthrough the package manager:\n\n    # zkg install zeek/spicy-plugin\n\nTo check that everything is set up correctly, confirm that the output of\n`zeek -N` looks like this:\n\n    # zeek -N _Zeek::Spicy\n    _Zeek::Spicy - Support for Spicy parsers (*.spicy, *.evt, *.hlto) (dynamic, version x.y.z)`\n\n## Installation\n\nSince this package is a meta-package, the easiest, and recommended way to\ninstall the analyzers is through the Zeek package manager:\n\n    # zkg install zeek/spicy-analyzers\n\nThis will pull down the package and its dependencies, compile and test the\nanalyzers, and then install and activate them. To check that the new analyzers are\navailable, run `zeek -NN` afterwards, it should list all the included\nSpicy analyzers:\n\n    # zeek -NN _Zeek::Spicy\n    [...]\n    [Analyzer] spicy_TFTP (ANALYZER_SPICY_TFTP, enabled)\n    [...]\n\nThe new analyzers are now available to Zeek and used by default when\nthe package is activated.\n\n## Configuration\n\nBy default, all included analyzers will be activated, and they will\nautomatically disable any standard analyzers that they replace. If you\nwant to disable one of the Spicy analyzers, you can do so by calling\none of the built-in functions\n[disable_protocol_analyzer/disable_file_analyzer()](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/zeek.html#functions).\nFor example, to disable the HTTP analyzer, add this to your\n`site.zeek`:\n\n```.zeek\nevent zeek_init()\n    {\n    Spicy::disable_protocol_analyzer(Analyzer::ANALYZER_SPICY_HTTP);\n    }\n```\n\nYou can find the `ANALYZER_*` value to use for an analyzer in the\noutput of `zeek -N _Zeek::Spicy`.\n\n(Note that `disable_file_analyzer()` requires a current development\nversion of Zeek to be available.)\n\n## License\n\nThis package is open source and released under a BSD license.
