Postgres is helpful in preserving states across BRO restarts.  For postgres backend support you'd need to install bro-postgresql package from: https://github.com/0xxon/bro-postgresql.git\n\nHowever, you can run this without postgres support. In that case, there will be limitation on how many URLs you can store in memory and keep track of. Historically we can keep up to 300-500K URLs without much problems.\n\nFor customization specific to your site/need please see: scripts/configure-variables-in-this-file.bro \n\n\n\n\nContact : Aashish Sharma, asharma@lbl.gov if you have further questions/interests \n"}
