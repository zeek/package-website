That knowledge is captured in the form of labels which are short strings that describe an object in some way.  \n\nLabels are broken down into two categories:  static and dynamic.  Static labels are ingested by Zeek via the Input Framework, where dynamic labels can be added by Zeek scripts during run-time.  \n\nThere are two forms of static labels currently supported:  cidr and flow (explained in more detail below).  \n\n###  Installation \n\nflow_labels is available as a Zeek package.  After installing the Zeek package manager, simply run the command `bro-pkg install flow_labels`.  Next add the load statement `@load flow_labels` to your Site policy file - usually local.bro.  \n\nAny customizations of constants defined by flow_labels can be made in your Site policy file.  At a minimum, this should include redef's of two input file constants *static_cidr_labels* and *static_flow_labels*.  See Configuring Inputs for more information.      \n\n####  Install straight from repo\n\nUse a git client to clone the repo to your local file system.  Ensure the location you clone to is accessible by the user running Zeek.  \n\n`git clone https://github.com/bricata/flow_lables flow_labels`\n\n If you clone the repo to a location in Zeek's path you can specify the module name only; e.g. `@load flow_labels`.  Alternatively, you can use an absolute path like `@load /opt/zeek_modules/flow_lables`.  For more information about configuring Zeek, see [this](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/components/broctl/README.html#configuration) and [this](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/components/broctl/README.html#option-reference).  \n\n####  Configuring Inputs \n\nflow_labels uses the Zeek Input Framework to read in label information from two files.   These files are specified by the constants *static_cidr_labels* and *static_flow_labels*.  You should add redef statements to your Site policy file to point these constants to the correct filesystem locations for each file.  For example:\n\n```\nredef flow_labels::static_cidr_labels = \"/opt/zeek_inputs/cidr.labels\";\nredef flow_labels::static_flow_labels = \"/opt/zeek_inputs/flow.labels\"; \n```\n"}
