After parsing is done it will fire an `HTTP_CSP::Report` event that can be used later to extend basic functionality,\n* Log every (or only some) report to `csp_report.log` file,\n* Use Bro Intelligence Framework to cross check domains in `blocked-uri` field against your threat intel.\n\nPackage contains 3 modules:\n\n* `main.bro` - required,\n* `logger.bro` - optional,\n* `intel.bro` - optional.\n\nYou can skip loading optional files in case you don't want to log reports or use intel framework.\n\n## tunables\n\nYou can also redefine following constants to customize package behaviour.\n\n* `HTTP_CSP::all_sites` - parse every report seen (look for `csp-report` keyword in every HTTP POST request),\n* `HTTP_CSP::monitored_sites` - parse only reports sent to specified hosts.\n"}
