For example, to use PF_RING to\nmonitor interface ``eth1``:\n\n    bro -i pf_ring::eth1\n\nTo use it in production with multiple Bro processes, use a configuration \nsimilar to this in node.cfg (e.g. /usr/local/bro/etc/node.cfg):\n\n    [worker-1]\n    type=worker\n    host=localhost\n    interface=pf_ring::zc:eth1\n    lb_method=pf_ring\n    lb_procs=8\n    pin_cpus=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nWhere lb_procs is the number of processes for load balancing (e.g. RSS)\nNow start the BroControl shell like:\n\n    broctl\n\nThe first-time, perform an initial installation of the BroControl configuration:\n\n    [BroControl] > install\n\nThen start the Bro instances:\n\n    [BroControl] > start\n\n"}
