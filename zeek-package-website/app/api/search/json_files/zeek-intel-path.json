Here is an example intel file that uses this type:\n\n```\n#fields\tindicator\tindicator_type\tmeta.source\n/malware\tIntel::URL_PATH\tTest IOC\n```\n\nAlerts will be generated in the `intel.log` and however else you have the Intel framework configured (e.g., email, `notice.log`, etc.).\n\nBy default, this package only alerts on the HTTP `original_URI`, which is the raw URL path seen on the network. To alert on the `unescaped_URI` (which decodes anything that is URL encoded), add the following to your `local.zeek`:\n\n```zeek\nredef Intel::seen_unescaped_uri = T;\n```\n\nYou can also disable alerting on the `original_URI` with the following:\n\n```zeek\nredef Intel::seen_original_uri = F;\n```\n\nBe aware that there may be a performance impact when alerting on both URI parameters."}
