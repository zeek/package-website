Combining VAST and Zeek allows threat\nhunters to automate routine tasks, such as correlating new intelligence feed\nitems with data from the past.\n\n## Features\n\n- Historic intelligence lookups: when new intelligence becomes available,\n  go back in time and look for connections that involved the new intelligence.\n\n- Query arbitrary data in VAST.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe scripts ship as a [Zeek package][zeek-pkg-mgr]. Installation follows the\nstandard procedure:\n\n```shell\nzkg install zeek-vast\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, make sure that VAST and [`zeek-to-vast`][zeek-to-vast] are running,\notherwise the scripts will not be able to communicate with VAST.\n\nTo enable historic intelligence lookups, just load the following script:\n\n```bro\n@load zeek-vast/intel.zeek\n```\n\nZeek then generates a new file `historic-intel.log` with the results of historic\nintelligence lookups.\n\nTo test your setup locally, you can load the [example intel file](example.intel)\nas follows:\n\n```shell\nzeek 'Intel::read_files += {\"example.intel\"}' scripts/intel.zeek\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee the `export` section of the scripts for a complete description of tuning\nknobs.\n\n### intel.zeek\n\nThis script integrates VAST with the [intelligence framework][intel-framework]:\nWhenever Zeek processes a new intelligence item, the script performs a historic\nlookup for the new item in VAST. If there exists relevant data, VAST sends the\nresult back, which the scripts then writes into the file `historic-intel.log`.\n\nIf there's currently no connection to VAST, then the script queues the item\nuntil the connection becomes available again.\n\n### main.zeek\n\nThis script defines the basic functions to communicate with VAST. You can\nconfigure how Zeek should connect to `zeek-to-vast` with the two variables\n`VAST::bridge_host` and `VAST::bridge_port`. They default to `127.0.0.1` and\n`43000/tcp`.\n\n## License\n\nThis Zeek package comes with a [BSD license](LICENSE).\n\n[vast]: https://github.com/tenzir/vast\n[intel-framework]: https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/frameworks/intel.html\n[zeek-to-vast]: https://github.com/tenzir/zeek-vast/tree/master/zeek-to-vast\n[zeek-pkg-mgr]: https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager\n"}
