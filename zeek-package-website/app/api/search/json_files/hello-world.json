Install as follows:\n\n```\n$ zkg install hello-world\n```\n\nThen, run it by saying:\n\n```\n$ zeek hello-world\n/path/to/your/zeek/share/zeek/site/hello-world/./main.zeek, line 5: Hello world! This is v1.0.\n```\n\nThe package writes a single line to the reporter.log, which Zeek by default also\nprints to stderr. To experiment with version selection, the package also\nprovides version `v0.1.0` and a development version on the main branch. The\nreported message indicates which version you've ended up installing.\n\nTo start your own package, don't copy this one! Instead, take a look at the [zkg\ncreate](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/zkg.html#create)\ncommand.\n"}
