[0xl3x1/zeek-EternalSafety]
description = EternalSafety is a Zeek package for detecting potentially-dangerous SMBv1        protocol violations that encapsulate bugs exploited by the infamous Eternal* family of Windows exploits. It is capable of detecting EternalBlue, EternalSynergy/EternalRomance,               EternalChampion, and the DoublePulsar backdoor. However, rather than identifying these         exploits via simple signature-matching, *EternalSafety* instead implements a set of SMBv1      protocol invariants that encapsulate techniques used by each Eternal* exploit to trigger bugs  in unpatched Windows systems. EternalSafety accurately and reliably identifies the             EternalBlue, EternalSynergy and EternalRomance exploits, and the DoublePulsar backdoor         implant. Due to limitations in Zeek's SMBv1 support, it has limited support for detecting      EternalChampion via signature-matching. EternalSafety also identifies a range of other         protocol violations, such as the use of unimplemented/unused SMBv1 commands, server-initiated  changes in values that may only be set by an SMBv1 client, and incorrect interleaving of       transaction types.
