It examines the initial exchange between a client and server communicating over GQUIC, and extracts the information contained in the connection's client hello packet and  server rejection packet.  Currently, this protocol analyzer supports GQUIC versions Q039 to Q046.\n\n## Installing the GQUIC Protocol Analyzer using Source Tree\n\n##### For a standard installation\n\n ```sh\n./configure --zeek-dist=/path/to/zeek/dist\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\n##### To see all options, including setting the install path, run:\n ```sh\n./configure --help\n```\n## CYU\nTo provide further insight and help detect anomalous (and potentially malicious) GQUIC traffic, fingerprinting is utilized.  The fingerprinting method, named \"CYU\" works by identifying the GQUIC version and tags present in client hello packets.  First, the version of the packet is extracted, immediately followed by a comma.  After this, each tag in the client hello packet is gathered and concatenated together with hyphens to delimit each tag.  For example: `46,PAD-SNI-STK-VER-CCS-NONC-AEAD-UAID-SCID-TCID-PDMD-SMHL-ICSL-NONP-PUBS-MIDS-SCLS-KEXS-XLCT-CSCT-COPT-CCRT-IRTT-CFCW-SFCW`.  After this string is created, it is then MD5 hashed to produce an easily shareable fingerprint.  Hashing the previous string results in a CYU value of `a46560d4548108cf99308319b3b85346`.  This is the most common fingerprint, making up the vast majority of GQUIC traffic.\n\n### Use case: Merlin C2\nThe CYU fingerprinting method can be very useful when it comes to detecting beacons transmitting to servers over GQUIC.  For example, Merlin C2 clients use very few tags in their client hellos, giving them an anomalous fingerprints.\nKnown Merlin beacon fingerprints: `e030dea1f2eea44ac7db5fe4de792acd`, `0811fab28e41e8c8a33e220a15b964d9`, `d8b208b236d176c89407500dbefb04c2`.\n\n## New Events Created\nThe GQUIC protocol analyzer adds new four events which can be called in Zeek scripts.\n### gquic_packet\n```sh\nevent (c: connection, is_orig: bool, hdr: GQUIC::PublicHeader)\n```\nGenerated whenever a regular GQUIC packet is raised.\n* **c**: The connection.\n* **is_orig**: True if the event is raised for the originator side.\n* **hdr**: A data type which contains the packet number, connection ID, and version of a GQUIC packet.\n\n### gquic_client_version\n```sh\nevent event(c: connection, version: count)\n```\nRaised whenever a GQUIC client sends a Regular Packet with a novel GQUIC version number.\n* **c**: The connection.\n* **version**: The version number seen in the packet.\n\n### gquic_hello\n```sh\nevent (c: connection, is_orig: bool, hdr: GQUIC::PublicHeader, hello: GQUIC::HelloInfo);\n```\nGenerated whenever a client hello packet is detected in GQUIC traffic.  It includes the additional information contained in the hello packet.\n* **c**: The connection.\n* **is_orig**: True if the event is raised for the originator side.\n* **hdr**: A data type which contains the packet number, connection ID, and version of a GQUIC packet.\n* **hello**: A data type which contains the information about the tags of a client hello packet.\n\n### gquic_rej\n```sh\nevent (c: connection, is_orig: bool, hdr: GQUIC::PublicHeader, rej: GQUIC::RejInfo);\n```\nGenerated whenever a rejection packet (server hello) is detected in GQUIC traffic.  It includes the additional information contained in the rejection packet.\n* **c**: The connection.\n* **is_orig**: True if the event is raised for the originator side.\n* **hdr**: A data type which contains the packet number, connection ID, and version of a GQUIC packet.\n* **rej**: A data type which contains the information about the tags of a server rejection packet.\n\n## New Constants\nDefined in the init.zeek script, a constant named `skip_after_confirm` is set to true.  This means that only the initial exchange between the client and server will be captured.  This is done to reduce noise, but it also reduces some visibility.  It can be set to true as one sees fit.\n\n## New Types Created\nThe GQUIC protocol analyzer adds three new data types which can be referenced in Zeek scripts.\n### type: PublicHeader\n```sh\npkt_num: count\ncid: string &optional\nversion_exists: bool\nversion: count &optional\n```\n* **pkt_num**: The packet number in the GQUIC traffic.\n* **cid**: The unique, client-selected, connection ID which defines the connection.\n* **version_exists**: True if the version number is in the packet header.\n* **version**: The GQUIC version used by the packet and stream.\n\n### type: HelloInfo\n```sh\ntag:\tcount;\ntag_list: string;\npadding_len:\tcount;\nsni:\tstring &optional;\nstk:\tstring &optional;\nsno:\tstring &optional;\nver:\tstring &optional;\nccs:\tstring &optional;\nnonc:\tstring &optional;\nmspc:\tstring &optional;\naead:\tstring &optional;\nuaid:\tstring &optional;\nscid:\tstring &optional;\ntcid:\tstring &optional;\npdmd:\tstring &optional;\nsmhl:\tstring &optional;\nicsl:\tstring &optional;\nctim:\tstring &optional;\t\nnonp:\tstring &optional;\npubs:\tstring &optional;\nmids:\tstring &optional;\nscls:\tstring &optional;\nkexs:\tstring &optional;\nxlct:\tstring &optional;\ncsct:\tstring &optional;\ncopt:\tstring &optional;\nccrt:\tstring &optional;\nirtt:\tstring &optional;\ncetv:\tstring &optional;\ncfcw:\tstring &optional;\nsfcw:\tstring &optional;\n```\n* **tag**: The total number of tags found in the client hello packet\n* **tag_list**: This captures the list of tags and their offsets in the order which they appear in the client hello packet.\n* **padding_len**: The offset at which padding length starts.

Currently only X509 is defined.\n* **smhl**: The value of support max header list (size).\n* **icsl**: The value denoting implicit shutdown.

This allows a server to operate without a strike-register and for clients with clock-skew to connect.\n* **svid**: The SVID tag was once found in a pcap of Merlin C2 traffic.  This tag is not currently supported by Wireshark.\n* **prof**: In the case of X.509, a signature of the server config by the public key in the leaf certificate.
