This second level of parsing is also done using the ASN.1 data types.\n  - events\n    - `ldap::message` - called for each LDAP message\n    - `ldap::bindreq` - when a bind request is made\n    - `ldap::searchreq` - basic search request information\n    - `ldap::searchres` - called each time a search result is returned\n  - enums\n    - `ProtocolOpcode`\n    - `ResultCode`\n    - `BindAuthType`\n    - `SearchScope`\n    - `SearchDerefAlias`\n    - `FilterType`\n  - Zeek log files\n    - `ldap.log` - contains information about all LDAP messages except those that are search-related. Log lines are grouped by connection ID + message ID\n      - `ts` (time)\n      - `uid` (connection UID)\n      - `id` (connection ID 4-tuple)\n      - `proto` (transport protocol)\n      - `message_id` (LDAP message ID)\n      - `version` (LDAP version for bind requests)\n      - `opcode` (set of 1..n operations from this uid+message_id)\n      - `result` (set of 1..n results from this uid+message_id)\n      - `diagnostic_message` (vector of 0..n diagnostic message strings)\n      - `object` (vector of 0..n \"objects,\" the meaning of which depends on the operation)\n      - `argument` (vector of 0..n \"argument,\" the meaning of which depends on the operation)\n    - `ldap_search.log` - contains information about LDAP searches. Log lines are grouped by connection ID + message ID\n      - `ts` (time)\n      - `uid` (connection UID)\n      - `id` (connection ID 4-tuple)\n      - `proto` (transport protocol)\n      - `message_id` (LDAP message ID)\n      - `scope` (set of 1..n search scopes defined in this uid+message_id)\n      - `deref` (set of 1..n search deref alias options defined in this uid+message_id)\n      - `base_object` (vector of 0..n search base objects specified)\n      - `result_count` (number of result entries returned)\n      - `result` (set of 1..n results from this uid+message_id)\n      - `diagnostic_message` (vector of 0..n diagnostic message strings)\n      - `filter` (search filter string)\n      - `attributes` (vector of 0..n \"attributes\", the attributes that were returned)\n  - test\n    - basic tests for detecting plugin presence and simple bind and search result/requests\n\nHere's what it doesn't have, which could be added by future parties interested in expanding it:\n\n- LDAP [referrals](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#section-4.1.10) are not parsed out of the results\n- [SASL credentials](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4511#section-4.2) in bind requests are not being parsed beyond the mechanism string\n- SASL information in bind responses are not being parsed; for that matter, SASL-based LDAP stuff hasn't been tested much and may have issues\n- Search filters and attributes: the search filters, reconstructed from the query tree, is represented in string format. The AND and OR filters have a tree structure and are parsed with the `ParseNestedAndOr` unit, whereas the NOT filter consist of one single nested SearchFilter and is parsed with a `ParseNestedNot` unit. The remaining filter types can all be decoded to a string using the `DecodedAttributeValue` unit, which takes the `FilterType` as a parameter. The `FILTER_PRESENT` consists of a single octet string and can be parsed directly. By recursively constructing leafs and nodes in the tree, the final search filter can be represented, e.g. `(&(objectclass=*)(sAMAccountName=xxxxxxxx))`. The returned attributes are represented in a list and returned to the `ldap_search.log` if `option default_log_search_attributes = T;` is set (the default is False).\n- the details of `SearchResultReference` are not being parsed\n- the only detail of `ModifyRequest` being parsed is the object name\n- the details of `AddRequest` are not being parsed\n- the details of `ModDNRequest` are not being parsed\n- the details of `CompareRequest` are not being parsed\n- the details of `AbandonRequest` are not being parsed\n- the details of `ExtendedRequest` are not being parsed\n- the details of `ExtendedResponse` are not being parsed\n- the details of `IntermediateResponse` are not being parsed\n- [Logging policy](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/logging.html#filtering-log-records) is available.\n\nUseful Links:\n\n- <https://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html>\n- <https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf>\n- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511#>\n- <https://ldap.com/ldapv3-wire-protocol-reference-asn1-ber/>\n- <https://lapo.it/asn1js>\n"}
