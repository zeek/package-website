{"description": "This plugin provides fuzzy hashing for Bro.", "tags": "bro plugin", "version": "0.3.0", "depends": ["bro >=2.5.0"], "test_cmd": "cd tests && btest -d", "build_cmd": "./configure --bro-dist=%(bro_dist)s && make", "url": "https://github.com/J-Gras/bro-fuzzy-hashing", "summary": null, "script_dir": null, "plugin_dir": "build/JGras_FuzzyHashing.tgz", "readme": "\n# JGras::FuzzyHashing\n\nThis plugin aims at integrating fuzzy hashing into Bro and is under development. Currently the following algorithms are supported:\n * [ssdeep](https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html)\n * [TLSH](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Plugin is based on libraries for *ssdeep (libfuzzy)* and *TLSH*. Make sure to install both libraries before installing the plugin.\n\n### Bro Package Manager\n\nThe plugin is available as package for the [Bro Package Manager](https://github.com/bro/package-manager) and can be installed using the following command:\n\n\tbro-pkg install https://github.com/J-Gras/bro-fuzzy-hashing\n\nTo install uncompiled plugins, Bro's source code must be available to the package manager (see package manager's [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J-Gras/bro-fuzzy-hashing/master/http://bro-package-manager.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#basic-configuration) for more information).\n\n### Manual Install\n\nThe following will compile and install the Fuzzy Hashing plugin alongside Bro, assuming it can find the required libraries in a standard location:\n\n\t# ./configure && make && make install\n\nIf the headers are installed somewhere non-standard, you can point `configure` to the proper location passing the following options:\n\n\t--with-ssdeep=<ssdeep-include-directory>\n\t--with-tlsh=<tlsh-include-directory>\n\nIf everything built and installed correctly, you should see this:\n\n\t# bro -NN JGras::FuzzyHashing\n\tJGras::FuzzyHashing - Fuzzy hashing support for Bro (dynamic, version 0.3)\n\t[File Analyzer] SSDeep (ANALYZER_SSDEEP)\n\t[File Analyzer] TLSH (ANALYZER_TLSH)\n\t[Event] file_fuzzy_hash\n\t[Function] ssdeep_hash_init\n\t[Function] ssdeep_hash_update\n\t[Function] ssdeep_hash_finish\n\t[Function] tlsh_hash_init\n\t[Function] tlsh_hash_update\n\t[Function] tlsh_hash_finish\n\n## Usage\n\nThe plugin provides opaque values for each algorithm as well as file analyzers, following standard Bro conventions. For examples see the test cases in `tests/scripts`.\n"}
