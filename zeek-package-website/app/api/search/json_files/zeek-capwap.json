Mainly focus on data channel (port 5247). It is packed as a Zeek package, which can be easily installed with [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/).\n\nThe CAPWAP protocol is defined in the following RFCs:\n- CAPWAP: [RFC 5415](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5415)\n- CAPWAP IEEE 802.11 binding : [RFC 5416](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5416)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore trying to install the package, make sure you have the following tools installed:\n\n- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)\n- [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) command `zkg`\n\nEverything should be installed correctly if you install the latest [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) version.\n\n\n### Setup\n\nA simple call to `make install` from the repository's root directory should install the package and run unit tests.\nYou can also use the `zkg` command directly:\n```shell\nzkg install https://github.com/AmazingPP/zeek-capwap  # to install as super user\nzkg --user install https://github.com/AmazingPP/zeek-capwap  # to install in user space\n```\n\nYou might have to update the `ZEEKPATH` and `ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH` environmental variables.\nTo see which value they should take, run the following commands:\n```shell\nzkg env         # For the super user\nzkg --user env  # For a normal user\n```\n\nTo confirm that installation was successful, you can run the following command:\n```shell\nzeek -NN | grep CAPWAP\n```\n\nIf the command's output shows something similar to:\n```\n[Packet Analyzer] CAPWAP (ANALYZER_CAPWAP)\n```\nthe package was correctly installed, and you have access to the CAPWAP packet analyzer.\n\nIn the case of any installation problems, please check the [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) documentation.\n\n### Events\n\nThe plugin defines the following events:\n- `event capwap_packet(outer: connection, inner: pkt_hdr)`\n  - Generated for any packet encapsulated in a CAPWAP tunnel.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the BSD license.
