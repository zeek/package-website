Ethernet/IP and CIP are often observed together. `cip.log` and `enip.log` contain metadata from their respective protocols while `enip_list_identity.log` contains addtional data extracted from specific ENIP messages relating to device identity.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\n`zeek-plugin-enip` is distributed as a Zeek package and is compatible with the [`zkg`](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/zkg.html) command line tool.\n\n## Sharing and Contributing\n\nThis code is made available under the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/amzn/zeek-plugin-enip/blob/master/LICENSE).
