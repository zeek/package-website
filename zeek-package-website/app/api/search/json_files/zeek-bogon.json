This functionality is disabled by default, as many Zeek users run Zeek on a local network where RFC 1918 traffic is expected.\n\nTo enable classifying RFC 1918/4193 private address space as bogon, add the following to your `local.zeek`:\n\n```zeek\nredef Bogon::private_as_bogon = T;\n```\n\nThis will mark these ranges as bogon:\n\n* `10.0.0.0/8`\n* `172.16.0.0/12`\n* `192.168.0.0/16`\n* `fc00::/7`\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is available via the Zeek Package Manager:\n\n```\n$ zkg install zeek-bogon\n```\n\n## Links\n\nFor more info on bogon ranges, please see the following:\n\n* [Bad Packets: Hunting for bogons and the ISPs that announce them](https://badpackets.net/hunting-for-bogons-and-the-isps-that-announce-them/)\n* [Wikipedia: Bogon filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogon_filtering)\n* [Team Cymru: The Bogon Reference](https://team-cymru.com/community-services/bogon-reference/)\n\n## Credits\n\nSome of the test traces were not generated by me:\n\n* [ipv6-smtp.pcapng](https://packetlife.net/captures/protocol/ipv6/): nacnud\n"}
