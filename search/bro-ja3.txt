JA3 for Bro
This module adds support for JA3 ssl fingerprinting for Bro IDS.

It is inspired by the salesforce module that creates the same functionality for Bro

This version of this functionality included far more documentation on its own code and eliminates much of the repetative code that was placed in the original Salesforce module.

It would have been great to simply contribute to the Salesforce module, unfortunately, at this time their contributor agreement makes it difficult for me to do so at this time.
