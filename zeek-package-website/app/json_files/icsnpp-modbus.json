This log file remains unchanged. This package extends Modbus logging capability by adding three new Modbus log files:\n* modbus_detailed.log\n* modbus_mask_write_register.log\n* modbus_read_write_multiple_registers.log\n\nFor additional information on these log files, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Package Manager\n\nThis script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manger](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html)\n\n```bash\nzkg refresh\nzkg install icsnpp-modbus\n```\n\nIf you have ZKG configured to load packages (see @load packages in quickstart guide), this script will automatically be loaded and ready to go.\n[ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)\n\nIf you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this script on a packet capture you can add `icsnpp-modbus` to your command to run this script on the packet capture:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-modbus.git\nzeek -Cr icsnpp-modbus/tests/traces/modbus_example.pcap icsnpp-modbus\n```\n\n### Manual Install\n\nTo install this script manually, clone this repository and copy the contents of the scripts directory into `${ZEEK_INSTALLATION_DIR}/share/zeek/site/icsnpp-modbus`.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-modbus.git\nzeek_install_dir=$(dirname $(dirname `which zeek`))\ncp -r icsnpp-modbus/scripts/ $zeek_install_dir/share/zeek/site/icsnpp-modbus\n```\n\nIf you are using a site deployment, simply add echo `@load icsnpp-modbus` to your local.site file.\n\nIf you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this package on a packet capture you can add `icsnpp-modbus` to your command to run this plugin's scripts on the packet capture:\n\n```bash\nzeek -Cr icsnpp-modbus/tests/traces/modbus_example.pcap icsnpp-modbus\n```\n\n## Logging Capabilities\n\n### Detailed Modbus Field Log (modbus_detailed.log)\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis log captures Modbus header and data fields and logs them to **modbus_detailed.log**.\n\nThis log file contains the functions (read/write), count, addresses, and values of Modbus coils, discrete inputs, input registers, and holding registers.\n\nA \"network_direction\" meta-data field is also included in the log.  The \"network_direction\" column specifies whether the message was a *request* or a *response* message. \nIf an exception arises in the Modbus data the exception code will be logged in the \"values\" field.\n\n#### Fields Captured\n\n| Field             | Type      | Description                                                       |\n| -----------------
