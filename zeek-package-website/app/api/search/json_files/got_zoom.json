The name of the server included in the notice indicates the authentication method - being Facebook, Google, SSO, or Zoom itself. \n- Raises a separate notice when the Zoom client joins a meeting. Only the name of the first meeting server connected to is included in the notice - there may be several meeting servers, each used for different purposes but all associated with the same meeting.\n\n## Background \nSee [https://zeek.org/2020/04/14/got-zoom/](https://zeek.org/2020/04/14/got-zoom/)  \n\n## Requires   \nJA3 and JA3S. Errors will occur if you don't have JA3 loaded *prior* to got_zoom.  Get JA3 [here](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3 \"JA3\"). \n  \n## Logic at a glance      \n  \n**Client Login:**   \n*   JA3 of Zoom client AND  \n*   JA3S of Zoom Login Servers AND  \n*   Zoom server_name AND  \n*   Zoom certificate  \n\n**Meeting Join**  \n*   JA3S of Zoom Meeting Server AND  \n*   Zoom server_name AND  \n*   Zoom certificate  \n\n## Usage\n### Stand alone mode:  \nMake sure you have JA3 loaded prior got_zoom being loaded, you can do this by editing the commented out line in `scripts/__load__.zeek` to point to your local copy of the JA3 files. \n\nYou can then use got_zoom on your pcap:  \n```zeek -Cr your.pcap scripts/__load__.zeek```\n\n### As a package: \nTo install the package.  \n```zkg install .```  \nOnce again, you must ensure that JA3 is loaded prior to the got_zoom load.  \n\n\n## Tested against\n- Zoom 4.6.10 (20041.0408) on OSX 10.15.3 \n- zeek version 3.2.0-dev.277\n\n## Output notice.log\n\n### Connection.  \nIn this example the Zoom client is authenticated with Facebook, indicated by a server_name of facebook.zoom.us.  \n  \n`\n1586823459.142204       ChMw6p3tKAfiyHngs3      192.168.13.37   57426   52.202.62.237   443     -       -       -       tcp     zoom_TLS::LoggedIn      Zoom Client connected to facebook.zoom.us.
