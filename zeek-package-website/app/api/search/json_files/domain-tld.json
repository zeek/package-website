It was created to help\nZeek developers easily discover if domains like `google.uk.co` are effectively TLDs. \nIt avoids the trouble of splitting on periods and making the incorrect assumption\nthat `uk` is the interesting component of the name. It also has functionality to \nextract the domain and subdomain from the FQDN.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n\tzkg install sethhall/domain-tld\n\nAPI\n---\n\nFor now, refer to the inline documentation in the `scripts/main.zeek` script.\n"}
