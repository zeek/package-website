It implements the following functionalities:\n\n * `udp`: Sees originator and responder of UDP connections. **Note:** The script uses the potentially expensive event `new_connection`.\n\n * `icmp-ping`: Sees originator and responder of ICMP echo requests and replies. **Note:** The script uses potentially expensive events.\n\n * `effective_dns`: Introduces the `Intel::EFFECTIVE_DOMAIN` indicator type for effective domains. For example \"wikipedia.org\" will match \"www.wikipedia.org\" and other subdomains. **Note:** The scripts require the [DomainTLD package](https://github.com/sethhall/domain-tld).\n\n * `conn-tcp`: Introduces the `Intel::CONN_TCP` indicator type supporting `<IP>:<Port>` indicators for *established* TCP connections.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe scripts are available as package for the [Zeek Package Manager](https://github.com/zeek/package-manager) and can be installed using the following command:\n```\nzkg install intel-seen-more\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default no script is loaded! To load all scripts add the following to your `local.zeek`:\n```\n@load packages\n@load packages/intel-seen-more/seen\n```\n\nSeen scripts can also be loaded selectively:\n```\n@load packages\n@load packages/intel-seen-more/seen/udp\n@load packages/intel-seen-more/seen/effective-dns\n```\n"}
