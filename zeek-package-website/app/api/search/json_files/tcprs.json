To use\nthe analyzer without the use of any of the provided scripts, you can\nenable it inside a ``bro_init`` handler::\n\n    event bro_init()\n\t    {\n        TCPRS::EnableTCPRSAnalyzer();\n        }\n\nIncluded with the analyzer is a collection of 103 test cases that\nare used for iterative design and refinement of the analyzer. Each\ntest case is used to verify a specific function of the analyzer or\ngeneral classification of events.\n"}
